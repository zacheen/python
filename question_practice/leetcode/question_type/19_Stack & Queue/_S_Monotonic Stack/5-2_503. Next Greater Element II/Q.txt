503. Next Greater Element II
找到下一個比此數大的數字是哪個數字 
如果沒有可以再從頭找 (所以應該只有最大的數字會回傳-1)
如果還是沒有回傳 -1

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
